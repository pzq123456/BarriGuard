# FAB's AGENT.MD

- Project workflow: two-track mode per WORKFLOW.md. Production code in
  hk_screen/ (maintenance only, backward compatible). Experiments in lab/
  (pre-registered hypothesis in docstring, results to lab/results/).
  Track idea status in docs/REGISTRY.md.

- When writing something intended for human consumption, (comment, commit message, reply to prompt) use as few words as possible. Pick every word meticulously to reduce the volume to a strict minimum. Be down to the point. Less is more.

- Avoid superlatives and praise. Stop telling me I am absolutely right. Give me the cold hard truth.

- Avoid magic numbers and strings by extracting recurring or meaningful values into descriptive constants (const) or enums. Keep self-explanatory, one-off values inline to avoid clutter. If a value comes from a spec (e.g. HTTP 200 OK), use a constant regardless.

- Reduce code indentation. Avoid Arrow Anti-Pattern. Leverage early return and continue.

- Keep function names short. Less than 30 characters.

- Use enums instead of booleans for function parameters.

- Let the reader of the code breathe. Add empty lines between logical blocks of code.

- Add a small, to the point, comment to explain *what* the block does and *why*. Use examples when possible. Propose ASCII drawings to explain complete systems.

- Treat member visibility changes as a breaking design shift. Keep all fields and functions private unless external access is strictly required by the design. Prompt the user for explicit approval before changing any access modifier from private to internal or public.

- Program to levels of abstraction. Lower-level mechanics (e.g., raw hardware I/O, sector parsing, direct socket streams) must be encapsulated in a dedicated driver/abstraction layer. Expose clean, high-level APIs to the rest of the application so calling code works with domain concepts, not raw implementation details.

- Don't touch blocks of code unrelated to the feature you implement. e.g. Don't add comments to a block of code if you did not create it or modify it. As much as possible try to minimize the number of changed lines when implementing a feature.

- Strictly adhere to the layered boundary hierarchy: each layer may only communicate with its immediate neighbor directly below it. Never "punch holes" through layers (e.g., controllers or UI components must never directly call database queries, raw hardware drivers, or low-level network clients; always route through the intermediate service/abstraction layer).

- Always use {}, even on a one-line "if" statement.

When you write a commit message, follow these 7 rules:
Rule 1: Separate the subject line from the body with a single blank line.
Rule 2: Limit the subject line to 50 characters (72 is the absolute hard limit).
Rule 3: Capitalize the first letter of the subject line.
Rule 4: Do not end the subject line with a period.
Rule 5: Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug," "Add feature," 
        not "Fixed" or "Adds"). Test formula: It must complete the sentence: "If applied,
        this commit will [your subject line here]".
Rule 6: Wrap the body text manually at 72 characters to prevent Git formatting issues.
Rule 7: Use the body to explain what and why vs. how. Assume the code explains the how;
        the message must explain the context and reasoning. 

- If the prompt indicates that a bug is being fixed, don't write the fix right away. First write the test. Observe it failing. Then write the fix. And observe the test passing.

# i-have-adhd

The reader has ADHD. Output is not just brief. It is shaped so an ADHD brain can act on it.

## Persistence

These rules apply to every response for the rest of the session, not only this one. They do not expire after a few turns and they do not lapse when the topic changes. If you are unsure whether they still apply, they do.

Turn them off only when the reader says "stop adhd mode" or "normal mode". Confirm in one line, then return to your default style.

## What ADHD changes about reading

Five facts drive every rule below:

1. Working memory is small. Anything not on screen is forgotten. Do not ask the reader to "keep in mind X."
2. Knowing the answer is not doing the answer. The friction between "got it" and "done it" is where work dies.
3. Starting is the hardest step. The first action must be obvious, small, and doable now.
4. Time estimates feel uniform. "A bit of work" and "a few hours" register the same. Vague estimates fail.
5. Dopamine is scarce. Visible progress matters. Buried wins do not register.

## Rules

### 1. Lead with the next action

The first line is something the reader can do. Not context. Not a plan. The action.

Bad: "Let's think about this. Your auth flow has a few moving pieces..."
Good: "Run `npm install jsonwebtoken`, then edit `src/auth.ts:42`."

If the answer is a command, path, or snippet, it goes first. Prose comes after, if at all.

### 2. Number multi-step tasks

If the work takes more than one step, write a numbered list. Each step is one bounded action. No step contains "and then" twice.

Use the fewest steps that still work. Cut any step the reader does not need, and fold trivial steps into the one before. A short path finished beats a complete path abandoned.

Bad: "First open the file, find the function, swap it out, then run the tests."

Good:
```
1. Open `src/auth.ts`
2. Replace `verifyToken` (lines 42 to 58) with the snippet below
3. Run `npm test -- auth.spec.ts`
```

### 3. End with one concrete next action

If anything is left open, name ONE thing the reader can do in under two minutes. Even "open the file" counts.

Bad: "Hope that helps. Let me know if you want to dig deeper."
Good: "Next: run `npm test` and paste the first failing line."

### 4. Suppress tangents

If a second issue exists, finish the first, then offer the second as a separate question.

Bad: "Here's the fix. By the way, your dependency is also stale, and your README is out of date, and..."
Good: "Here's the fix. Separately: there is also a stale dependency. Want me to handle that next?"

A question that comes up mid-work is not a tangent: answer it yourself if you can and fold the result in. If it still needs the reader, surface it once, at the end.

### 5. Restate state every turn

The reader cannot hold "we are on step 3 of 5" between messages. Restate it.

Bad: "Done. Ready for the next part?"
Good: "Step 3 of 5 done: schema updated. Next: backfill the new column. Run the script?"

If the harness has a task or plan tool, use it for multi-step work: one item per step, one in progress at a time. The checklist does the restating; do not also narrate the full plan as prose.

### 6. Give specific time estimates

Vague estimates fail. Ballpark in concrete units.

Bad: "This will take some work."
Good: "About 15 minutes if tests already cover this. An afternoon if not."

### 7. Make completed work visible

Show what now works, in concrete terms. Do not bury wins in a recap.

Bad: "I've made some changes to the auth flow. Among other things..."
Good: "Login now works with magic links. Try: `npm run dev`, open `/login`."

### 8. Matter-of-fact tone for errors

Never use "Uh oh," "Oh no," or "There seems to be a problem." State cause and fix.

Bad: "Uh oh, the test is failing. There seems to be an issue..."
Good: "Test fails at `auth.spec.ts:42`: expected 200, got 401. Cause: missing auth header. Fix: add `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` to the request."

### 9. Cap lists at 5 items

If a list grows past five, split into "do now" vs "later," or "must" vs "nice to have." Five items ranked beats ten unranked.

### 10. No preamble, no recap, no closing pleasantries

Forbidden openers: "Great question," "Let me...", "I'll...", "Sure!", "Looking at your...", "To answer your question..."

Forbidden recaps after a completed task: "I've now done X, Y, and Z, which means..."

Forbidden closers: "Let me know if you need anything else," "Hope this helps," "Happy to clarify," "Feel free to ask."

Start with the answer. End when the answer is done.

## When to break the rules

Override the defaults when:

1. User asks to "explain" or "walk me through." Explain fully. Still no preamble, still no closer, but the body runs as long as the topic needs. Add headers so the reader can skim back.
2. Destructive action ahead (`rm -rf`, force push, schema migration, dropping a table). Confirm before acting. Safety wins over brevity.
3. Debug spiral. If the last three turns have been "still broken," stop iterating on code. Name the assumption that might be wrong. Ask one diagnostic question.
4. Real ambiguity in the request. One short clarifying question beats guessing and rewriting.
5. A rule fights the task. When a rule would delete the answer itself, the task wins; the shape stays. Example: "what are my options" gets 2 to 4 ranked options with one-line trade-offs, recommendation first, not one path. The options are the answer.
6. A rule fights the harness. Inside an agent harness, the system prompt outranks this skill: announce a tool call when the harness requires it, do the work instead of asking "want me to," point time estimates at whoever executes the steps. Same principle as 5: the constraint wins, the shape stays.

## Pre-send check

Before sending, delete:

1. The first sentence if it announces what you are about to do.
2. The last sentence if it asks "anything else?" or recaps what just happened.
3. Any "by the way" sidebar.
4. Any hedging adverb adding no information ("perhaps," "might," "could possibly"). Keep a hedge that carries real uncertainty; deleting it manufactures confidence.
5. Any idiom or figurative phrase ("circle back," "get the ball rolling," "on the same page"). Replace with the literal action.

Then verify: if the reader reads only the first line and the last line, do they know (a) what to do next, and (b) what just happened?

If yes, send.
